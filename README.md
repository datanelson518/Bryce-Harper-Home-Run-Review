# Bryce Harper Home Run Review

*Jon Nelson*

## Description

---

From a recent capstone project that I completed I reviewed home run data from the 2015, 2016, and 2017 MLB seasons to analyze what was influencing the launch speeds on home run hits and ultimatley leading to an increase in home runs. I realized that through this project I could get even more granular in the data and review home runs by MLB divisions, leagues, teams and players. So, I decided to look at one of the leagues best and most popular players, Bryce Harper. Through this analysis I will explore Harper's home run stats from the 2015, 2016 and 2017 seasons to then feed a model to predict the home run exit velocities for each home run that he has hit. From this model I can obtain the most influential features involved in his home run hits that are giving him the velocities that he is obtaining.
